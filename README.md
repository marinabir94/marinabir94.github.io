# Portfolio
This is the **1st** project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

**[View here.](https://marinabir94.github.io/)**

In this project, I designed and implemented a personal Curriculum Vitae.  The website I create must be responsive, and must provide an overview of each of my education, and work experiences.    I am free to personalize the design as I wish.

## Quickstart
- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).
- Clone the repository, navigate to this project, and install dependencies.
```
  git clone https://github.com/Tempurturtul/udacity-fend-projects.git
  cd udacity-fend-projects/fend-portfolio/
  npm install
```
- Run the default gulp task to serve source files. *(See `gulpfile.js` for additional tasks.)*
