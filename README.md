# Portfolio
This is the **1st** project in Udacity's [Front-End Engineer Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path) program.

**[View here.](https://marinabir94.github.io/)**

In this project, I designed and implemented a personal Curriculum Vitae.  The website I create must be responsive, and must provide an overview of each of my education, and work experiences.    I am free to personalize the design as I wish.
